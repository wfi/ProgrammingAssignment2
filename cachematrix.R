## R Code for Programming Assignment 2 in 
## Coursera R Programming course

## These functions are supposed to manage a matrix and allow
## the inversion of the matrix to be cached and subsequently
## retrieved (if the matrix has not been modified since the cache)

## makeCacheMatrix: create a matrix-like object that
## supports various getters and setters as well caching the inversion

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve: given a matrix, return the inverse utilizing the
## cache if it exists and computing (and caching) if it doesn't exist

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
